# Asylum
*Asylum* is a **1.21.11 Fabric** client-side mod that allows for custom client-side scripting into the game via the resource pack.
The mod allows for lua scripts to be embedded into a resource pack to be ran in-game.

> [!CAUTION]
> The safety of the lua embedded is unknown.
> 
> There should be no way to access Java API's from Lua, but there is always a chance.
> 
> **Use at your own caution.**

## Lua Documentation
The lua documentation will come in the future, due to the early stage of development.
API's can and will change before version v1.0.0.
